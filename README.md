Helper for my github issue

Hello! Welcome to my python slack sample program. Please add your bot token and desired channel to post into the variables at the top of the app.py file.

Run the bot, and it will print formatted text to the console and slack. This was written to show that fixed-width columns in python do not transfer correctly to slack.
